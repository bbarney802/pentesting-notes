# Burp Suite Other Modules

Specifically, we will be looking at the Decoder, Comparer and Sequencer tools. These allow us to: work with encoded text; compare sets of text; and analyse the randomness of captured tokens, respectively. Being able to perform these relatively straightforward tasks directly within Burp Suite can save a lot of time, so it is well worth the time spent learning to use these modules efficiently.

Without further ado, let's jump in and start looking at Decoder!

### Decoder

The Burp Suite Decoder module allows us to manipulate data. As the name suggests, we can decode information that we capture during an attack, but we can also encode data of our own, ready to be sent to the target. Decoder also allows us to create hashsums of data, as well as providing a Smart Decode feature which attempts to decode provided data recursively until it is back to being plaintext (like the "Magic" function of Cyberchef).

Let's select the Decoder tab from the top menu and take a look at the options available:

This interface offers us a number of options.

The box on the left is where we would paste or type text to be encoded or decoded. As with most other modules of Burp Suite, we can also send data here from other sections of the framework by right-clicking and choosing Send to Decoder.

We have the option to select between treating the input as text or hexadecimal byte values at the top of the list on the right.

Further down the list, we have dropdown menus to Encode, Decode or Hash the input.

Finally, we have the "Smart Decode" feature, which attempts to decode the input automatically.

As we add data into the input field, the interface will duplicate itself to contain the output of our transformation. We can then choose to operate on this using the same options:

### Encoding/Decoding Methods

Let's take a closer look at the manual encoding and decoding options. These are the same whether we choose the decoding or encoding menu:

Plain: Plaintext is what we have before performing any transformations.

URL: URL encoding is used to make data safe to transfer in the URL of a web request. It involves exchanging characters for their ASCII character code in hexadecimal format, preceded by a percentage symbol (%). Url encoding is an extremely useful method to know for any kind of web application testing.

For example, let's encode the forward-slash character (/). The ASCII character code for a forward slash is 47. This is "2F" in hexadecimal, making the URL encoded forward-slash %2F. We can confirm this with Decoder by typing a forward slash in the input box, then selecting Encode as -> URL:

HTML: Encoding text as HTML Entities involves replacing special characters with an ampersand (&) followed by either a hexadecimal number or a reference to the character being escaped, then a semicolon (;). For example, a quotation mark has its own reference: ". When this is inserted into a webpage, it will be replaced by a double quotation mark ("). This encoding method allows special characters in the HTML language to be rendered safely in HTML pages and has the added bonus of being used to prevent attacks such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

When we use the HTML option in Decoder, we can encode any character as its HTML escaped format or decode captured HTML entities. For example, to decode the quotation mark we looked at before, we type in the encoded variant then choose Decode as -> HTML:

Base64: Another widely used encoding method, base64 is used to encode any data in an ASCII-compatible format. It was designed to take binary data (e.g. images, media, programs) and encode it in a format that would be suitable to transfer over virtually any medium. How this works under the hood is not important at this point; however, if you are interested, you can read the maths behind it here.

ASCII Hex: This option converts data between ASCII representation and hexadecimal representation. For example, the word "ASCII" can be converted into the hexadecimal number "4153434949". Each letter in the original data is taken individually and converted from numeric ASCII representation into hexadecimal. For example, the letter "A" in ASCII has a decimal character code of 65. In hexadecimal, this is 41. Similarly, the letter "S" can be converted to hexadecimal 53, and so on.

Hex, Octal, and Binary: These encoding methods all apply only to numeric inputs. They convert between decimal, hexadecimal, octal (base eight) and binary.

Gzip: Gzip provides a way to compress data. It is widely used to reduce the size of files and pages before they are sent to your browser. Smaller pages mean faster loading times, which is highly desirable for developers looking to increase their SEO score and avoid annoying their customers. Decoder allows us to manually encode and decode gzip data, although this can be hard to process as it is often not valid ASCII/Unicode. For example:

When combined, these methods give us a great deal of control over the data that we are encoding or decoding.

As you may have noticed from the examples, each encoding/decoding method is colour coded to allow us to quickly and easily see what transformation has been applied.

Hex Format:

Inputting data in ASCII format is great, but sometimes we need to be able to edit our input byte-by-byte. For this, we can use "Hex View" by choosing "Hex" above the decoding options:

This setting allows us to view and edit our text in hexadecimal byte format -- a very useful trick if we are working with binary files or other non-ASCII data.

Smart Decode:

Finally, let's take a look at the "Smart Decode" option. This feature of Decoder attempts to automatically decode encoded text. For example, Burp Suite, is automatically recognised as being HTML encoded and is automatically decoded accordingly:

This feature is far from perfect, but it can be very useful for quickly decoding chunks of unknown data.

### Practical:

The best way to internalize this is by putting it into practice, so here are some examples. Try to complete these questions using Burp Suite Decoder as far as possible.

Base64 encode the phrase: Let's Start Simple.

What is the base64 encoded version of this text?

TGV0J3MgU3RhcnQgU2ltcGxl

URL Decode this data: %4e%65%78%74%3a%20%44%65%63%6f%64%69%6e%67.

What is the plaintext returned?

Next: Decoding

Use Smart Decode to decode this data: %34%37.

What is the decoded text?

47

Encode this phrase: Encoding Challenge.

Start with base64 encoding. Take the output of this and convert it into ASCII Hex. Finally, encode the hex string into octal.

What is the final string?

24034214a720270024142d541357471232250253552c1162d1206c

### Hashing

Hashing is a one-way process that is used to transform data into a unique signature. To be a hashing algorithm, the resulting output must be impossible to reverse. A good hashing algorithm will ensure that every piece of data entered will have a completely unique hash. For example, using the MD5 algorithm to generate a hashsum for the text "MD5sum" returns 4ae1a02de5bd02a5515f583f4fca5e8c. Using the same algorithm to generate a hashsum for "MD5SUM" gives a completely different hash, despite the similarities of the input: 13b436b09172400c9eb2f69fbd20adad. For this reason, hashes are frequently used to verify the integrity of files and documents, as even a very small change to the file will result in the hashsum changing significantly.

Equally, hashes are also used to securely store passwords as (due to the one-way hashing process meaning that the hashes can never be reversed) the passwords will be (relatively) secure even if the database is leaked. When a user creates a password, it is hashed and stored by the application. When the user tries to log in, the application will then hash the password they submit and check it against the stored hash; if the hashes match, then the password was correct. When using this methodology, an application never has to store the original (plaintext) password.

Hashing in decoder

Decoder allows us to generate hashsums for data directly within Burp Suite; this works in much the same way as the encoding/decoding options we saw in the previous task. Specifically, we click on the "Hash" dropdown menu and select an algorithm from the list:

Continuing our earlier example, let's enter "MD5sum" into the input box, then scroll down the list until we find "MD5". Applying this sends us automatically into the Hex view:

This is because the output of a hashing algorithm does not return pure ASCII/Unicode text. As such, it is common to take the resultant output of the algorithm and turn it into a hexadecimal string; this is the form of "hash" that you may be familiar with.

Let's finish this by applying an "ASCII Hex" encoding to the hashsum to create the neat hex string from our initial example.

### Comparer Overview

As the name suggests, Comparer allows us to compare two pieces of data, either by ASCII words or by bytes.

This interface can be split into three main parts:

On the left, we have the items being compared. When we load data into Comparer, it will appear as rows in these tables -- we would then select two datasets to compare.

On the upper right, we have options for pasting data in from the clipboard (Paste), loading data from a file (Load), removing the current row (Remove) and clearing all datasets (Clear).

Finally, on the bottom right, we have the option to compare our datasets by either words or bytes. Don't worry about which of these buttons you select as this can be changed later on. These are the buttons we click when we are ready to compare the data we have selected.

As with most Burp Suite modules, we can also load data into Comparer from other modules by right-clicking and choosing "Send to Comparer".

When we have loaded data in to compare, we get a pop-up window showing us the comparison:

At the bottom right of the window is the "Sync views" checkbox. When s elected, this means that both sets of data will sync formats -- i.e. if you change one of them into Hex view, the other will do the same to match.

### Sequencer Overview

Sequencer is one of those tools that rarely ever gets used in CTFs and other lab environments but is an essential part of a real-world web app penetration test.

In short, Sequencer allows us to measure the entropy (or randomness, in other words) of "tokens" -- strings that are used to identify something and should, in theory, be generated in a cryptographically secure manner. For example, we may wish to analyze the randomness of a session cookie or a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token protecting a form submission. If it turns out that these tokens are not generated securely, then we can (in theory) predict the values of upcoming tokens. Just imagine the implications of this if the token in question is used for password resets...

There are two main methods we can use to perform token analysis with Sequencer:

Live capture is the more common of the two methods -- this is the default sub-tab for Sequencer. Live capture allows us to pass a request to Sequencer, which we know will create a token for us to analyse. For example, we may wish to pass a POST request to a login endpoint into Sequencer, as we know that the server will respond by giving us a cookie. With the request passed in, we can tell Sequencer to start a live capture: it will then make the same request thousands of times automatically, storing the generated token samples for analysis. Once we have accumulated enough samples, we stop Sequencer and allow it to analyse the captured tokens.

Manual load allows us to load a list of pre-generated token samples straight into Sequencer for analysis. Using Manual Load means we don't have to make thousands of requests to our target (which is both loud and resource intensive), but it does mean that we need to obtain a large list of pre-generated tokens!

We will be focusing on live captures in this room.

Let's learn to use the Sequencer live capture by performing entropy analysis on the anti-bruteforce token used in the admin login form.

We will start by capturing a request to http://10.10.112.101/admin/login/ in the Proxy. Right-click on the request and choose "Send to Sequencer":

Notice in the "Token Location Within Response" section we have the option to select between Cookie, Form field, and Custom location. In this instance, we are testing the loginToken, so select the radio button for "Form field":

We can safely leave all other options at default in this instance, so let's go ahead and click the "Start live capture" button!

A new window will now pop up telling us that we are performing a live capture and showing us how many tokens we have so far captured. We need to wait until we have a reasonable number of tokens captured (around 10,000 should do); the more tokens we have, the more accurate our analysis.

Once you have around 10,000 tokens captured, click "Pause", then select the "Analyze now" button:

Note: We could also have chosen to "Stop" the capture; however, by choosing to pause it instead, we leave the option resume the capture open, should the report not have enough samples to calculate the entropy of the token accurately.

If we wanted to receive periodic updates on the analysis, we could also have checked the "Auto analyze" checkbox. Doing this would tell Burp to perform the entropy analysis every 2000 requests or so, giving us frequent updates that will get progressively more accurate as more samples are loaded into Sequencer.

It is worth noting that at this point, we could also choose to copy or save the captured tokens for further analysis later on.

Having clicked the "Analyze now" button, Burp will proceed to analyse the entropy of our token and generate a report. We will look through this in the next task.

Follow the steps above to perform entropy analysis on the loginToken set by the /admin/login route of our target web app.

Try performing the capture again, but this time monitor your requests in Wireshark. Can you see why live capturing the requests for this analysis can be described as "loud"?

### Sequencer Analysis

Now that we have a report for the entropy analysis of our token, it's time to analyse it!

Burp performs dozens of tests on the token samples that it captured. We won't be looking at all of these as it would take far more than a single task to do so (and it would get very maths-intensive to break each technique apart). Instead, we will focus on the generated summary; however, you are encouraged to look through all of the test results for yourself.

The generated entropy analysis report is split into four primary sections -- the first of these being a summary of the results:

The summary gives us an overall result; the effective entropy; an analysis of the reliability of the results; and a summary of the sample taken.

Collectively, these will often be enough to determine whether the token is generated safely or not; however, in some instances, we may need to have a look at the test results directly -- this can be done in the "Character-level analysis" and "Bit-level analysis" tabs. As mentioned previously, we will not be going into these to avoid delving into the depths of statistical-analysis mathematics in a beginner-friendly room. In short, with an estimated 1% chance of being incorrect based on the data provided (Significance level: 1%), Burp has calculated that the effective entropy of our token should be around 117 bits. This is an excellent level of entropy to have in a secure token, although it should be noted that it is impossible to say with absolute assurance that this calculation is entirely accurate, simply due to the nature of the topic.

You should now be comfortable using Decoder to transform data; Comparer to look for differences between two datasets; and Sequencer to perform entropy analysis on tokens.

### Burp Extender

This room will focus on Burp Suite's modular aspects: the exposed functionality, which allows developers to craft extra additional modules for the framework.

Coding Burp modules is far outwith the scope of this module, but we will take a quick look at the API documentation, as well as going over the typical process for adding new modules using the Burp Suite "BApp" store.

Let's start by taking a look through the Extender interface:

The default view in the Extender interface gives us an overview of the extensions that we have loaded into Burp Suite. There are none in the screenshot above -- we will change this in the next few tasks. The first box (towards the top of the interface) provides us with a list of extensions that we have installed and allows us to activate or deactivate them for this project.

The options to the left of this box allow us to uninstall extensions with the Remove button or install new ones from files on our disk with the Add button. These could be either modules that we have coded or modules that have been made available on the internet but are not in the BApp store. The Up and Down buttons in this section control the order that installed extensions are listed in. Extensions are invoked in descending order based on this list. In other words: all traffic passing through Burp Suite will be passed through each extension in order, starting at the top of the list and working down. This can be very important when dealing with extensions that modify the requests as some may counteract or otherwise hinder one another.

Towards the bottom of the window, we have Details, Output and Errors for the currently selected module. These can be used to view module information, as well as for debugging.

### The BApp Store

The Burp App Store (or BApp Store for short) gives us a way to easily list official extensions and integrate them seamlessly with Burp Suite. Extensions can be written in a variety of languages -- most commonly Java (which integrates into the framework automatically) or Python (which requires the Jython interpreter -- more on this in the next task!).

Let's start by installing a Java extension, just to get a feel for the BApp store.

The Request Timer extension (Written by Nick Taylor) allows us to log the time that each request we send takes to receive a response; this can be extremely useful for discovering the presence of (and exploiting) time-based vulnerabilities. For example, if a login form takes an extra second to process requests that contain a valid username than it does for accounts that do not exist, then we can quickly generate a list of possible usernames and use the difference in times to see which usernames are valid.

Switch over to the "BApp Store" sub-tab, then search for "Request Timer". There should only be one result. Click on the returned Extension, then click "Install":

Notice that a new tab appeared in the main menu at the top of the screen. Different extensions have different behaviours: some merely add a new item to right-click context menus; others create entirely new tabs in the main menu bar.

As this was just an example of using the BApp store, we won't cover using the Request Timer here; however, switching to the new tab and taking a look is highly recommended!

### Jython

If we want to use Python modules in Burp Suite, we need to have downloaded and included the separate Jython Interpreter JAR file. The Jython interpreter is a Java implementation of Python. The website gives us the option to either install Jython to our system or download it as a standalone Java archive (JAR). We need it as a standalone archive to integrate it with Burp.

Note: we can do the same thing with Ruby modules and the JRuby integration; however, we will not cover this here as: A) Python modules are much more common and B) it's exactly the same process for both.

First up, we need to download an up-to-date copy of the Jython JAR archive from the Jython website. We are looking for the Jython Standalone option:

Save the JAR file somewhere on your disk, then switch to the "Options" sub-tab in Extender.

Scroll down to the "Python Environment" section, and set the "Location of Jython standalone JAR file" to the path of the archive:

Simple as that, we can now install Python modules from the BApp store!

This is a very simple step that significantly increases the number of extensions available to us.

### The Burp Suite API

Whilst coding our own modules is far outwith the scope of this module, it is worth looking (very briefly) at how such a task might be approached.

Extender exposes a large number of API Endpoints that new modules can hook into when integrating with Burp Suite.

We can view these in the "APIs" sub-tab:

Each item in the list on the left of this sub-tab documents a different API endpoint -- all of which can be called from within extensions. The endpoints here give developers a lot of power when writing extensions to interact seamlessly with the existing functionality of Burp Suite. As you may expect, we can interact with these endpoints in any of the languages supported by Burp Suite for use in extensions: Java (natively), Python (via Jython), and Ruby (via JRuby).

If you are particularly interested in coding your own extensions for Burp Suite, PortSwigger provide a wonderful reference which can be found here.
